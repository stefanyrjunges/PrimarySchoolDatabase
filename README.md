<h3>Description</h3>
<p align="justify">
With tables dedicated to students, families, staff, extracurricular activities, subjects, grades, and classrooms, the database provides a centralized repository for crucial information. By leveraging this organized framework,
educational institutions can effectively manage student and staff records, assign classrooms and coordinate extracurricular activities.
The project also includes example queries tailored to address common operational challenges faced by schools. These queries demonstrate how the database can be utilized to
generate insightful reports, identify trends, and optimize resource allocation.
In essence, this Primary School Database serves as a valuable tool for enhancing efficiency, promoting transparency, and fostering better decision-making within primary school administrations.
